    "### STATEMENT FROM DR. ROBERT MALONE: Before you inject your child\n",
    "\n",
    "My name is Robert Malone, and I am speaking\n",
    "to you as a parent, grandparent, physician and\n",
    "scientist. I don't usually read from a prepared\n",
    "speech, but this is so important that I wanted to\n",
    "make sure that I get every single word and\n",
    "scientific fact correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "```JTS: If this was important to you -- why are you not providing clear unambiguous citations for these extraordinary```\n",
    "\n",
    "I stand by this statement with a career dedicated\n",
    "to vaccine research and development. I'm\n",
    "vaccinated for COVID and I'm generally\n",
    "pro-vaccination. I have devoted my entire career\n",
    "to developing safe and effective ways to prevent\n",
    "and treat infectious diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "```JTS: Let me get this straight. So you claim to be the \"inventor\" of mRNA Vaccines, and have fought like hell to claim a large amount of patents and rights to mRNA based therapeudics, *but* you also claim mRNA is radical experimental treatment. Pick a side, you can't have it both ways.```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you inject your child - a decision that is\n",
    "irreversible - I wanted to let you know the\n",
    "scientific facts about this genetic vaccine, which\n",
    "is based on the mRNA vaccine technology I\n",
    "created:\n",
    "There are three issues parents need to\n",
    "understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is that a viral gene will be injected\n",
    "into your children's cells.\n",
    "`No, it will be injected into the muscle tissue and exist primarily as extracellular material, some of which will be taken up by surrounding cells. Not a big deal, but if you wanted to 'make sure each word you spoke was true', you'd be wording things more carefully than you are.`\n",
    "This gene forces your\n",
    "child's body to make toxic spike proteins. These\n",
    "proteins often cause permanent damage in\n",
    "children's critical organs, including\n",
    "- Their brain and nervous system\n",
    "```citation needed, not provided```\n",
    "- Their heart and blood vessels, including blood clots\n",
    "```citation needed, not provided. All COVID vaccine related clotting has been attributed to adenovirus-vector based vaccine platforms (J&J / AstraZeneca). The *ONLY* vaccine approved for use in persons <18 is Pfizer/BioNTech.```\n",
    "- Their reproductive system\n",
    "```citation needed, not provided. No plausible mechanism to transport intramuscualar spike to reproductive tract```\n",
    "- And this vaccine can trigger fundamental changes to their immune system\n",
    "```citation needed, not provided```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most alarming point about this is that\n",
    "once these damages have occurred, they are\n",
    "irreparable\n",
    "- You can't fix the lesions within their brain\n",
    "```citation needed, not provided```\n",
    "- You can't repair heart tissue scarring\n",
    "```citation needed, not provided```\n",
    "- You can't repair a genetically reset immune system, and\n",
    "```citation needed, not provided```\n",
    "- This vaccine can cause reproductive damage that could affect future generations of your family\n",
    "```citation needed, not provided```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask yourself if you want your own child to be\n",
    "part of the most radical medical experiment in\n",
    "human history\n",
    "â€¢ One final point: the reason they're giving you\n",
    "to vaccinate your child is a lie.\n",
    "O Your children represent no danger to their\n",
    "parents or grandparents\n",
    "O It's actually the opposite. Their immunity,\n",
    "after getting COVID, is critical to save your\n",
    "family if not the world from this disease\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary: there is no benefit for your\n",
    "children or your family to be vaccinating your\n",
    "children against the small risks of the virus, given\n",
    "the known health risks of the vaccine that as a\n",
    "parent, you and your children may have to live\n",
    "with for the rest of their lives.\n",
    "The risk/benefit analysis isn't even close.\n",
    "As a parent and grandparent, my\n",
    "recommendation to you is to resist and fight to\n",
    "protect your children."
