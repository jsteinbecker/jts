1. Making people get a shot that doesn't stop them from spreading anything.
2. Forcing military to quarantine in solitude when more military died from suicide than covid during the pandemic.
3. Letting people "fact check" with opinions
4. Closing schools and businesses when the southern border is wide open
5. Giving out free doughnuts to people who get a shot for a virus that exclusively kills unhealthy people.
6. Listening to anything Dr. Fauci says
7. Waiting hours for PCR tests when you aren't sick especially when multiple sources have commented on their accuracy
8. Wearing a mask alone in your car
9. Suppressing information and intentionally smearing treatments that are proven to work
